Turns out, it doesn't have to be that way: Frameworks like [milligram](https://milligram.io/) & [skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) are well below 1000 LOC and look stunning. Using one of those would have certainly been an option. Nonetheless, I stuck to starting from scratch - I want to understand the tools I'm using (CSS in this case) and this felt like the best way forward. I didn't end up with anything drastically different from what I would have gotten using those frameworks - but now I understand a little more about what those rules actually do.
