I found http://learnlayout.com/ to be a good starting point for css in general. From there I went off looking for the basics of typography and other basics of design found quite a few interesting posts <sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>. My key takeaways were:

- do not use more than 2 fonts
- set body font-size to ~16px
- decrease contrast of headlines (and maybe body): e.g. color: #222
- set line-height to ~1.4
- limit line length to ~60-90 characters (this one cannot be done directly but has to be approximated using the content width)

There are a lot of other things that people consider to be important but those few points above feel like the sweet spot to me (for now). They had the most impact on how easy I find it to read, how easy I find it to follow and distinguish the individual lines of the text.

Even with just those few points it's possible to go down the rabbit hole, e.g. with responsiveness. Fluid type was one thing that really caught my interest there for some time <sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup>, but in the end it didn't really feel worth it and I just stuck to the basics. In the end, the content is what's important and a good enough but simple stylesheet is just the tradeoff I want.
