Kenneth Arrow's 1951 Nobel Prize winning "Social Choice and Individual Values" questioned whether the axiom of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives is ever feasible in electoral systems <sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup>. He argued that it is not by showing it is incompatible with the following three other *non-negotiable* axioms. In the context of voting, they are as follows:

- **Unrestricted Domain:** each voter should be allowed to cast any valid ballot they wish.
- **Unanimity:** if every voter prefers candidate A over candidate B, then A should win vs. B.
- **Non-Dictatorship:** no single voter should always get their way in every possible election <sup>[3](#footnote-3)</sup>.

Unanimity failing, or a voter being a dictator are absurd on face. However, the reason **Unrestricted Domain:** should be considered non-negotiable is more subtle. Consider **Unrestricted Domain:** doesn't hold, i.e., there is a situation where the populace casts their votes and their government rejects the election outright. Arguably, the electoral system in question is *impractical* or *undemocratic*. Impractical due to the rejection of a likely time-consuming and expensive election, and undemocratic due to individuals not being allowed to vote how they wish *all* the time.

>**Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that there is no electoral system that satisfies all of Unrestricted Domain, Unanimity, Non-Dictatorship and Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives axioms**

In other words, every electoral system has the trade-off of violating at least one of those four axioms <sup>[4](#footnote-4)</sup>. It doesn't matter if we use Instant Run-Off voting as the Australians do, first-past the post as the English do, two-round voting as the French do, assign points to votes like the Nauruans do, thumbs-up and thumbs-down like the Latvians do, or the clamouring of spears on shields like the Ancient Spartans do.
