Since 1946, the party that holds government in Australia's has been a contest between two major parties: the **Labor Party** (a left-wing party) and the **Liberals** (a right-wing party, typically in coalition with the National party). That said, the performance of various minor parties and independent candidates often influences which major party wins. In this post, I want to focus on one minor party in particular: the **Greens** party (a far-left party) and for simplicity, will pretend no other candidates exist.

In *this* election, ballots typically ranked candidates from the three parties according to the left-right alignment per voter <sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>, i.e.:

- If a voter ranked the Liberals 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup>, their next preference was typically Labor rather than Greens. This is because the Greens are further left-wing than Labor, so, a right-wing Liberal voter typically preferred Labor next.
- If a voter ranked Labor 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup>, their next preference was typically Greens.
- If a voter ranked the Greens 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup>, their next preference was typically Labor.

In other words, a first-preference Liberal ballot typically had a most-to-least preferred ordering: **Liberal < Labor < Greens**, a first-preference Labor ballot had ordering: **Labor < Greens < Liberal**, and a first-preference Greens ballots had ordering: **Greens < Labor < Liberal**.
