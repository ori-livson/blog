I don't believe as some do, that Arrow's Impossibility Theorem spoils the project of fair voting itself. **The way I see it is that Arrow's Impossibility Theorem is a testament to voting being a highly expressive process.** By expressive I mean, an election outcome can hold preferences that no individual necessarily held, i.e., the whole is *different* to its parts. **However, expressivity means trade-offs are inevitable**. In other words, **if one desires voting without trade-offs** (i.e., one where the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives axiom holds), **only a very dull system is feasible** (i.e., one with a dictator).

This principle can be found in other domains. For example, if one wanted English to be unambiguous, or free from Self-Referential Paradoxes (e.g., the sentence *"This sentence is false"*), one would need to remove so many words and grammatical forms that English would also become very dull.

In fact, my aforementioned 2025 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06589) demonstrates formal links of this sort by relating the trade-offs of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to the trade-off incompleteness in logic (specifically, GÃ¶del's First Incompleteness Theorem). A post outlining that paper is coming soon.
