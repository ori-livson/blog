I don't believe as some do, that Arrow's Impossibility Theorem spoils the project of fair voting itself. The way I see it is that:

>**Arrow's Impossibility Theorem is a testament to voting being a highly expressive process.**

By "expressive", I mean an election outcome consist of preferences that no individual necessarily initially held, i.e., the whole is *different* to its parts. However, **expressivity means trade-offs are inevitable**. In other words, **if one desires voting without trade-offs** (e.g., one where the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives axiom holds), **only a very dull system is feasible** (e.g., one with a dictator).

This principle can be found in other domains. For example, if one wanted English to be unambiguous, or free from Self-Referential Paradoxes (e.g., the sentence *"This sentence is false"*), one would need to remove so many words and grammatical forms that English would also have to become very dull.

In fact, another 2025 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06589) of mine demonstrates formal links of this sort by relating the trade-offs of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to the trade-off of incompleteness in logic (specifically, Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem)<sup>[9](#footnote-9)</sup>. A post outlining that paper is coming soon.
