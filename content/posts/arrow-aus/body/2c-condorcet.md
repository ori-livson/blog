The suspicion theorems like Arrow's Impossibility Theorem hold, largely grew out of the heated debates preceding the French Revolution on how voting ought to be done. A pivotal momenet came when the French polymath Nicolas de Condorcet observed a problem with a voting-method known as **Pairwise Majority Voting** <sup>[5](#footnote-5)</sup>.

The voting-method is simple: use the ballots to assess the candidates head-to-head, and rank winners and losers **transitively**. Transitivity means, for example, that if the Greens win against the Liberals, and the Liberals win against Labor, then the Greens win against Labor.

Pairwise majority voting satisfies Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, Unanimity and Non-Dictatorship by definition, however, it fails Unrestricted domain due to presence of **Condorcet Paradoxes**.

The simplest example of a Condorcet Paradox occurs for the election of 3 candidates as per Figure 4. The calculation for **Greens win vs Liberals** is shown, and one can likewise calculate that **Liberals win vs. Labor**, and **Labor wins vs. Greens** this way. However, by transitivity (Greens win vs Liberals, which wins vs Labor) it must also be the case that **Greens win vs Labor**, a contradiction!

In fact, this isn't just a toy problem; in the 2014 Victorian state elections, had Victoria used pairwise majority voting rather than instant run-off voting, a Condorcet Paradox would have occurred in the electorate of Prahran <sup>[6](#footnote-6)</sup>.
