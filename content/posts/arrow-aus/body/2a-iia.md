A social decision-making process satisfies the axiom of "Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives" if:

> The decision of alternatives A vs. B depends only on A and B.

In other words, the addition or removal of any other alternative C shouldn't affect the decision of A vs. B. In hindsight, this may seem obviously unattainable for many electoral systems. However, to understand the intuition for desiring the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives axiom, consider the following anecdote about philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser.

> Morgenbesser is at a diner, ordering dessert and is told by a waiter that he can choose between blueberry or apple pie. So, he orders apple pie. Soon after, the waiter comes back and explains that cherry pie is also an option. Morgenbesser then replies "In that case, I'll have blueberry pie!".

Not only is this a strange response by an individual, it would still be a strange outcome of a group of customers voting on what pie to serve. Perhaps strange because of the sense in which the cherry pie option is an *afterthought*.
