A social decision-making process satisfies the axiom of "Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives" if:

> The decision of alternatives A vs. B depends only on A and B.

In other words, the addition or removal of any other alternative C shouldn't affect the decision of A vs. B. In hindsight, this may seem obviously unattainable for electoral systems. However, to understand the intuition for the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives axiom, consider the following anecdote about philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser.

> Morgenbesser is at a diner, ordering dessert and is told by a waiter that he can choose between blueberry or apple pie. So, he orders apple pie. Soon, the waiter comes back and explains cherry pie is also an option. Morgenbesser then replies "In that case, I'll have blueberry".

Not only is this a strange response for an individual, but it would be a strange response after a vote by the customers because of the sense in which the cherry pie option is an afterthought.
