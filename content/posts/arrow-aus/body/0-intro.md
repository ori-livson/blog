There are many ways to hold elections; the [Wikipedia page on Electoral Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system) is full of colour-coded world maps of different ways to do so, including 24 types of electoral systems for lower house / unicameral elections alone (see Figure 1).

>**The one thing all electoral systems have in common is that they all have trade-offs.**

By trade-off, I mean some seemingly desirable guarantee about the *behaviour* of elections doesn't necessarily hold. For example, in some electoral systems, one cannot guarantee that a candidate always benefits from receiving more votes. The study of these trade-offs in social decision-making processes such as elections, trial by jury, budget allocation, etc. is a major theme of the field of **Social Choice Theory**.

The purpose of this post is to introduce key topics of Social Choice Theory using examples from the 2025 Australian Federal Election. A particular phenomenon of interest in this election is how many lower-house candidates won or lost their seats based on who came 3<sup>rd</sup> in their race. The story of the electoral system trade-off that phenomenon corresponds to is a consequence of Social Choice Theory's most famous result: **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem**. Moreover, this story provokes an interesting question of whether that trade-off is a bug or a feature of Australia's electoral system.

**Note:** the election figures of this post are accurate as of 12.05.2025 (9 Days after the election) but are subject to change as counting continues.
