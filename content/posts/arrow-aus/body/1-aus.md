Australia uses an electoral system called **Instant Run-Off Voting**; voters rank candidates *1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>*, etc. in whatever order they wish, then a winner is picked using the following procedure:

1. To begin, each candidate is assigned a ballot total of those that rank them 1<sup>st</sup>.
2. If any candidate's ballot total is greater than 50%, they are declared the winner.
3. Otherwise, the candidate with the lowest ballot total is eliminated and each of their ballots are redistributed to next highest-ranked candidate - adding to the new ballot totals (see Figure 2).
4. Repeat 2-3 until a winner is declared.

>**This system has interesting dynamics, e.g., a party's first preferences share can by 0.46% from 33.34% to 34.8%, and it means the difference between losing with 68/151 seats (Labor, 2019) and winning with 93/151 seats (Labor, 2025).**
