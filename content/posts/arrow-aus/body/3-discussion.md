To reiterate, describing the failure of the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives axiom in the Australian electoral system a "trade-off" is not an argument that system is flawed in the sense of being unfair or undemocratic. To the contrary, labelling Labor as the centre-candidate for simplicity:

> **Our Electoral System does not simply average the left-right alignment of voters.**

1. Melbourne's 2010-2025 Greens victories were possible given a weak enough centre (i.e., Labor 1<sup>st</sup> preference) vote.
2. Otherwise, the system met conservative voters in the middle, given a strong enough middle (e.g., despite Melbourne maintaining a further left than Labor average alignment with a 40.1% Greens and 31.4% Labor 1<sup>st</sup> preference shares, the Greens' -9.5% and Liberals' +4.1% swings sufficed to flip the seat <sup>[8](#footnote-8)</sup>).
