Using the term "trade-off" to describe the failure of the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives axiom in the Australian electoral system is not an argument that the Australian system is unfair or undemocratic. To the contrary, the trade-off arguably represents a sophistication in the Australian system, wherein:

> **The Australian Electoral System does not simply average the left-right alignment of voters.**

Moreover, labelling Labor as the centre-candidate for simplicity, one can argue:

1. Melbourne's 2010-2025 Greens victories were possible given a weak enough centre (i.e., Labor 1<sup>st</sup> preference votes).
2. Otherwise, the system meets conservative voters in the middle, given a strong enough middle. For example, despite Melbourne being further left-leaning than Labor on average (due to its 40.1% Greens and 31.4% Labor 1<sup>st</sup> preference votes), the Greens' -9.5% and Liberals' +4.1% swings sufficed to flip that seat to the centre.
