Here, I'd like to discuss some other interesting, related topics in Social Choice Theory that manifest in the Australian System. This will hopefully emphasise the relevance of Social Choice Theory and also drive home the more philosophical argument about expressiveness vs trade-offs.

Firstly, on the assumption of voter's preferences typically respecting left-right alignment. Not only is that not the case for everyone, but some voters stand to gain by voting against their *honest preferences*. For example, in Australia, voters who most prefer one major party may preference the other major party last (i.e., below fringe candidates). This is done in order to prevent the less desired major party from securing a majority too early in the instant run-off voting process. In Social Choice Theory, this is called **Strategic Voting**, and has been common in Australia at times, contrary to 2025 (see [Footnote 1](#footnote-1)). An Arrovian result for strategic voting is the Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite Theorem.

Secondly, on a more positive note, when Strategic Voting is low, the Australian System typically satisfies **Monotonicity**, meaning "a candidate always benefits from receiving more votes". This is because one receiving more votes typically means receiving them from ballots preferencing closely aligned candidates, i.e., ballots that likely preferences them soon after. Thus, one receiving more votes typically means eliminating closely aligned candidates earlier, which causes their ballots to flow sooner.

Monotonicity can't be taken for granted in the best of times. For example, it does not hold in the French national system, which holds up to two "choose-one" elections, where the second is held between the top two performing candidates if a majority is not reached by anyone in the first round. Monotonicity doesn't hold in this system because if a candidate cannot attain a majority in the first round, they best ensure their second round opponent is one they can actually defeat head-to-head. Thus, if a candidate receives too many votes, that may prevent all defeatable candidates from appearing in the next round.

Finally, a fascinating result from Social Choice Theory that reiterates the value of all these chaotic edge-cases and trade-offs is **May's Theorem**, which states that **the only monotone voting method where all voters and all candidates are interchangeable is two-party majority voting.** Thus, to have the expressiveness of multi-candidate and preferential voting, one must learn to embrace the trade-offs.
