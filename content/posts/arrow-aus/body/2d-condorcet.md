Although many proofs of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem have been found since 1951, Condorcet Paradoxes were typically merely seen as intuition for why Unrestricted Domain fails when the other axioms hold. However, in 2024, Prof. Massimo D'Antoni devised an ingenious proof that in the strict case (i.e., when ties between candidates aren't allowed): **Unrestricted Domain fails because one can always find an election that produces a Condorcet Paradox**. A proof that this holds in the full case of Arrow's Impossibility was shown in a 2025 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09076) I wrote with Mihkail Prokopenko <sup>[8](#footnote-8)</sup>.
