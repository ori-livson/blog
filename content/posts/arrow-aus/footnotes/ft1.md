Preferences don't always flow this way; not only is left-right alignment not the be-all-end-all for every voter's preferences (or even well-defined), but sometimes voters *strategically* vote away from their *honest* preferences. For example, sometimes the Liberal Party advises its voters to preference Greens before Labor to diminish Labor's power. This influences the Greens winning certain Queensland electorates in 2022 - see [Antony Green's analysis](https://antonygreen.com.au/vic22-the-impact-of-the-liberal-partys-change-of-preference-recommendation/) for other examples. Indeed, *strategic voting* is another major theme of Social Choice Theory.
