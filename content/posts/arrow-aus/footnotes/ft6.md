Condorcet's Paradox was originally discovered - but lost - in the 13th century by Catalan philosopher and theologian Ramon Llull in his 13th century book "Artifitium electionis personarum" (The Art of Elections). Llull's work mainly investigated into church governance. Moreover, even Condorcet's contributions were largely ignored until the 1950's; as put by Professor Iain McLean:

> The theory of voting is known to have been discovered three times and lost twice. The work of Condorcet, Borda, and Laplace was entirely ignored from about 1820 until 1952, with the sole exception of E. J. Nanson's paper 'Methods of Election', which was read to the Royal Society of Victoria in 1882, published in a British Government Blue Book of 1907, and languished there undiscussed until 1958.
