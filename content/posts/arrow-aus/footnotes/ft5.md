The examples which aren't obviously ranked-choice voting systems can be converted / modified to ranked-choice voting systems. For example, First Past the Post can trivially use ballots where non-first preferences are ignored. The French two-round system however, is more challenging to emulate with preferential voting. This is because honest preferences after 1<sup>st</sup> have to be evaluated relative to all hypothetical pairs of candidates that may be in the second round, which is subject to Condorcet Paradoxes.
