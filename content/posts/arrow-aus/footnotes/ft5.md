All those examples of electoral systems can be converted / modified to ranked-choice voting systems. For example, First Past the Post trivially ignores non-first preferences, and the French System, which holds 2 separate "choose-one" elections, could be emulated by having single ballots with a top candidate, then the rest are ranked in a transitive, pairwise head-to-head fashion (lest one's preferences forms a Condorcet Paradox) or by desirability in terms of being 1 of the final two candidates (without knowing the other).
